OpenTTD has a number of dependencies. Unfortunately, no prebuilt binaries have
been provided at this time so you will have to build them yourself. 
Here's the list of dependencies:

lzma:     Instructions are provided in the lzma subfolder.
SDL 1.2:  This is provided on GitHub at https://github.com/blackberry/SDL.
TiMidity: Instructions are provided in the timidity subfolder.
TouchControlOverlay: GitHub at https://github.com/blackberry/TouchControlOverlay

OpenTTD also relies on libpng and zlib, but these are already provided in the
NDK and prebuilt on device.
