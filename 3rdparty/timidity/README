Build Instructions
1. Download TiMidity. TiMidity can be downloaded at http://sourceforge.net/projects/libtimidity/files/libtimidity/0.1.0/libtimidity-0.1.0.tar.bz2/download.
 This will download an archive file. Extract the contents to this directory.
 There should be a libtimidity-0.1.0 folder already present here.
2. Open the NDK. Import a project into your workspace from this directory.
3. There is one minor code change required so that TiMidity can find the patch
 files to play music. In timidity.c, you need to add the directory 
 app/native/timidity to the path list, and set the config_file to be 
 app/native/timidity/timidity.cfg. 

Here's the unified patch.
