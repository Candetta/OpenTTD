Build Instructions
1. Gather dependencies
   You will require a number of other libraries in order to build OpenTTD. Each dependency is located in a separate repository. The list is as follows:
    - lzma
    - SDL (1.2)
    - TiMidity
    - TouchControlOverlay

   Checkout all of the repositories and import the projects into a workspace in the NDK. 

2. Build project
   First you should choose a build configuration (Device-Debug, Device-Release, or Simulator) and make sure all the projects have that build configuration selected. Then select the openttd project and build it.

3. Run
   Create a new run configuration for openttd. You will need to specify runtime arguments otherwise the game will likely not display correctly. The required arguments are:
   -b 32bpp-optimized -r 1024x600

   This will choose the 32bpp optimized tileset and select the correct resolution. Click Run to start the game. Have fun!
